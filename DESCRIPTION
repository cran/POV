Title: Partition of Variation Variance Component Analysis Method
Version: 0.1.4
Author: Paul Deen [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Paul Deen <paulext@gmail.com>
Description: An implementation of the Partition Of variation (POV) method as
    developed by Dr. Thomas A Little <https://thomasalittleconsulting.com> in
    1993 for the analysis of semiconductor data for hard drive manufacturing.
    POV is based on sequential sum of squares and is an exact method that
    explains all observed variation. It quantitates both the between and within
    factor variation effects and can quantitate the influence of both continuous
    and categorical factors.
